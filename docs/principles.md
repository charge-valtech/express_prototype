# Principles

The prototyping kit:

- is designed for prototyping, not for production code
- is as simple as possible without teaching bad habits
- requires minimal skills to get started: HTML, CSS
- makes use of existing GOV.UK tools and templates; the GOV.UK template, GOV.UK front end toolkit and GOV.UK elements
- allows for server-side code
- can be extended - for example using NPM to install a module, access datastores, etc.
- makes it easy to share prototypes with others online
- should be fully documented in a way that is accessible to the target audience.
